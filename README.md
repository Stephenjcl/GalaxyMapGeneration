# GalaxyMapGeneration
Slowly being organized, an assemblage of years of scripts which produce a fictional galaxy map. Original R version produced a ggplot "jump map" with K-means generated territorial boundaries. Python version is aiming to be more realistic, utilizing the Garnets repo as a backbone to generate realistic worlds. All generation is procedural. All stars can even have images produced to match their colour and luminosity.
