# GalaxyMapGeneration
Slowly being organized, an assemblage of years of scripts which produce a fictional galaxy map. Original R version produced a ggplot "jump map" with K-means generated territorial boundaries. Python version is aiming to be more realistic, utilizing the Garnets repo as a backbone to generate realistic worlds. All generation is procedural. All stars can even have images produced to match their colour and luminosity.


There is also a PDF output generator which will provide a (not to scale) system map of each star. This is useful for say, Stars Without Number, when you want to provide a single system of information.
Plan to include more fictional elements as needed for creative writing inspiration.
